# Algorithm Study Scripts

This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed to help you learn and study various algorithms. Each script demonstrates a different algorithm and showcases its implementation in a simple, easy-to-understand way. By running these scripts, you can see how each algorithm works, how it performs in terms of speed, and how many steps (or tries) it takes to reach a solution.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a set of hands-on examples for learning and understanding fundamental algorithms such as linear search and binary search. These scripts are especially useful for beginners who are just starting out in algorithmic thinking and programming.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/algorithm-study-scripts.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-study-scripts
   ```

3. Run the desired Python script:
   ```bash
   python linear_search.py
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   python binary_search.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the maximum number in the series and the number to search for. The script will perform the search and display the results.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how different search algorithms work.
- Analyze the performance of these algorithms in terms of time and steps.
- Gain hands-on experience by modifying and experimenting with the scripts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute additional algorithms or improvements to these scripts, feel free to fork this repository and create a pull request.
